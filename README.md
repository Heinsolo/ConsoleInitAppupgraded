# Code Louisville C# Project

This project is an Initiative App for the popular tabletop RPG Dungeons and Dragons. Some of the biggest parts of D&D are battles between players and enemies. Because there are so many players and characters involved in the battle, everyone is assigned an Initiative number, which orders the players by initiative for when they can take their turn.
