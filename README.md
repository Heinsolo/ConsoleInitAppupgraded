# Code Louisville C# Project

This project is an Initiative App for the popular tabletop RPG Dungeons and Dragons. Some of the biggest parts of D&D are battles between players and enemies. Because there are so many players and characters involved in the battle, everyone is assigned an Initiative number, which orders the players by initiative for when they can take their turn. 

The application is set up in menu form, prompting the user with options to add characters, place characters into parties, and assign initiative rolls to characters. The app will then put them in initative order so the game manager can reference it during battles.

The app also has an option to save characters, parties, and initiative rolls to a .txt file. The app will ask you to type out a file name. I'd suggest just "Test". You can also choose from the main menu to load in from a data file. So as long as you type in the same file, it will load all of the information you saved from the previous session.

There is a saved group of characters in the "Test" file attached to the project. If you'd like to load up that group of characters, just select Load file from the main menu and type in the filename "Test"
