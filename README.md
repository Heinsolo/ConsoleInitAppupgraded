# ConsoleInitApp

\\I'm having a hard time figuring out the issue with the menus in my app. For example, currently the main menu and the Add Character menu are both working. But when I press "1" in the Character Menu to add a name, I can't get that method to run. I want to store the response as a variable and save it somewhere.
